    List all distributions that can be build against.
    This will not list distributions that are available via [interconnect](https://openbuildservice.org/help/manuals/obs-user-guide/cha.obs.concepts.html#id-1.5.10.3.5).
    Check /distributions/include_remotes for this.

# FIXME: This endpoint doesn't work. It should be fixed before we document it.
#        It's not documented in the non-Swagger API documentation.
#        PUT /distributions would do the same (while also deleting all existing distributions). This is confusing!
