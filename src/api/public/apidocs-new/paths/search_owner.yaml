get:
  summary: Search for the users or groups who are the owners of a project or package.
  description: |
    The owners are users/groups with the maintainer or bugowner roles in the given project/package.

    By default the owner search will get results from projects (and their sub-projects) that have the
    OBS:OwnerRootProject attribute.

    You can search for the package name, a user login, a group title or a binary package name.
    If you don't want to search the default projects, you can provide another project to search in.
